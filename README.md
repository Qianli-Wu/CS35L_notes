# CS35L_notes

Hello, this repo is where my notes for Discussion 1E will be posted every Friday in Fall 2022. 

* There might be some terrible mistakes, please let me know if you spot one so I can correct it ASAP.

* To have the same beautiful style as I do in Discussion, please see rendered HTML files.

* If you find this repo useful, feel free to star this project (at the top right corner) to find it quickly next time. 

* Your feedback is precious to me! Feel free to reach out to me before / after the discussion, or you can submit an issue for this repo, or I'll figure out other ways to do it.

### Markdown Editor Recommendation

* Typora

  * I'm using Typora with Liquid theme, so if you open my notes in other text editor or other themes, the style of markdown file may be subject to change
