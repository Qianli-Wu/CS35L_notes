* ### How to "edit" an older commit?

  ```{shell}
  $ git rebase -i (other branch) # -i = interactive;
  edit 68e342 ... # make some changes to previous commit 68e342, then git add, then git rebase --continue
  reword 68e342  # change the commit message for commit 68e342
  ```

  * Only Edit History in Repo that is not shared

  * Aside: **Change History**

    ```shell
    $ git commit --amend    # Change most recent Git commit message
    ```

  * **Stashing**

    * Work in progress

      ```shell
      $ git stash <save "save message"> # save the working image, with some message
      $ git stash list # check existed stashes
      $ git stash pop # reapply previously stashed changes, remove stashed changes
      $ git stash apply <ID> # reapply but keep stashed files
      $ git stash show # view a summary of a stash 
      $ git stash clear # delete all stash
      $ git stash drop stash@{1} # drop the second stash
      ```

    * Alternetive (control the history)

      ```shell
      $ git diff > my.diff  # store difference in a file my.diff
      $ git checkout main  # switch working in main branch
      [edit....commit]
      $ git checkout p  # check back to older version
      $ patch -p1 < my.diff  # restore the progress
      ```

      ```sh
      $ diff A B >B-A.diff
      $ patch <A-B.diff. # edit A to make it look like B, A = A + (A-B.diff) == B
      ```

* ### Git Internals

  * **plumbing** - low level stuff implementors care about  `e.g. git cat-file <file hash id>`
  * **porcelain** - beauty treatment: *user-friendly* interface.  `e.g. git rebase`
  * `./git` subdirectories:
    1. `branches/` useless now
    2. `config` configuration
    3. `HEAD` head branch, which branch the current HEAD at? directory to another file
    4. `hooks`/ specifies well-know
       - where creating your own porcelain (self-defined user-friendly commands)
    5. `index` represent the next change
    6. `info/exclude` things you don't want to pay attention to, like `.gitignore` but not in repository
    7. `logs/` records when branch trips were updated
    8. `objects/` files added to git repository
       - at first it stores all files compressed by zlib with name 40 bit hash
       - However, size too big for object and too many files under single directory
       - Thus, store first 2 digits as folder name, thus divides the number of files by 256
       - `git clone` will create a read-only hard links to those history files in repository, thus very cheap
    9. `pack-ref` what all the names of commits, (tags)
    10. `refs` not optimized version of `pack-ref`
  * **Like POSIX file system, multiple pointers to a file (hardlink)**
    * like a virtual file system implemented above traditional file system, like VPN in network
    * `git hash-object` provides a bunch of bytes and it returns SHA-1 checksum of it
      * SHA-1 designed to be **reliable**, secure
      * it's really expensive to have different string to hash same SHA-1 value
      * attacker will have great trouble pretending other message was sent instead of the original
