* # History of Version Control System (VCS)

  http://www.zhuda6.com/new/61abbb92e1f24435844c59469198acce.html

* ### SCCS Source Code Control System -1972

  * Each source file F had a version file , has checksum but no encryption or compression

  * | metadata |      | ...  | beta^2 | beta^1 | s.data.txt |
    | -------- | ---- | ---- | ------ | ------ | ---------- |

  * local user + single file, retrive a file O(size(F)) 

* ### RCS Revision Control System (free software) - 1982

  * right before metadata, there's a copy of most recent copy of F

  * Then, the difference of copy with previous version

  * Then , the difference between previous version and earlier version, recursively.

  * **cons**: It's more expensive to retrieve older version

  * **pros**: It's cheaper to retrieve most recent version

  * | metadata | copy of F_n | diff F_n and F_{n-1} | diff F_n-1 and F_n-2 | diff.... |      |
    | -------- | ----------- | -------------------- | -------------------- | -------- | ---- |

* ```$ diff A B >B-A.diff```
  * Compute B - A, show differences between new file B and old file A
* ```$ patch A < B-A.diff```
  * Generate a file, which is A + (B-A), which is old file + the difference with new file
* ```$ patch - R B <B-A.diff```
  * Generate a file, which is B - (B-A), which is new file - the difference with new file

* ### CVS Concurrent Version System -1989

  * RCS front end, second generation
  * Support single commits that can change multiple files.
  * **client-server model**, centralized
  * **issues**:  scaling (based on RCS) - thousands of clients  | 1 server that must stay up

* ### Bitkeeper (linux development switchent)

  * SCCS + distributed Version Control System
  * not open source at first so replace by git

* ### Git 

  * replacement for Linux development switc
  * dirtributed *version control* system built atop a distributed *file* system (POSIX)
    * history of project
    * planned future of project ( index | staging area | cache )
  * ```$ git clone ... ``` make a copy of history of project and checkout working files from latest version

* **Error Correction Code RAM (bank system)**
  
  * correct single-bit error
  * detect 2-bit error by checksum
  
* ##### Which source files belong in version control?

  * Automatically-generated source file
    * **pros**: people can just type 'make'
    * **cons**: git history too much
  * Bootstrapping process
    * Put minimum source files that can generate all source files
    * a file called 'bootstrap', which connect these course files with all source file
  * './configure'
    * generates platform-dependent configuration
    * Do 'bootstrap' in one machine and 'config' in another machine
  * './gitignore'
    * Do not add files to git 

* ##### git commands

  * ```git init```
  * ```git clone```
  * ```git diff```
    * ```git diff A..B``` Give difference between A and B

  * ```git ls-files	``` 
    * shows files under version control
  * ```git status```
  * ```git add``` 
    * add file F to the (index | staging area | cache)  - plan for next commit
  * ```git log```
