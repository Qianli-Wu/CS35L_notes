* ### Git Internal Structure

  * `git cat-file` , `HEAD^{tree}`
  * `git unpdate-index`  add a file to index
  * `git write-tree` write a tree for what's in index
  * `git commit-tree TREEID -p PARENT_COMMITID` commit a tree, they type commit message
  * SHA_1 prevents cycling in git internal
  * Git cannot compress **jpeg** like file very well, but we can store them somewhere else and sore pointers to them
  
  * **Bolb**
  * **Tree** - directory, maps names to other objects (other trees and bolbs)
    * (mode) octal number: file type (100: regularfile, 040: directory) + default permissions (644 rw for users an r for others)
    * type 
    * commit id
    * Name
  * **Commit** - labeled object, containing **commit** **message** + **times** + **tree** **object** + ...

* ### Compression

  * Objects are represented in compressed form
  * Ways compression is done  **zlib $$ \approx $$ gzip**
  * compression quality (the ratio between compressed and original file)
  * performance (CPU time)
  * zlib/gzip compression ideas
    * **Huffman coding** - proved to be optimal for its problem
      * Assume input is a sequence of symbols from a finit set (bytes 0-255)
      * output is a bit string, each bit represents some bytes in input
        * common symbols with shortest bit
        * rarely used symbols with longer bits
      * Problem: 
        * more prone to data crush: if a bit in output is incorrect, then if may affect many others behind it. 
        * Can't figure out what's the last character since it can only read from front to end to decode
    * <img src="/Users/qianli/Downloads/Huffman_coding_example.png" style="zoom:30%;" />
    * classic haffman coding
      * compressor + decompressor know tree structure in advance
      * zlib computes the tree on the fly
        * after each input symbol, the compressor updates its tree
        * the decompressor knows this
    * **dictionary coding** 
      * requires more memory, can use a lot of RAM
        * Sliding window approach
          * remove older words if the dictionary size is too much
      * dictionaries won't be saved
        * decopression is relatively cheap O(N)
        * compression is expensive O($$N^2$$)
      * fixed
        * the compressor and decopressor shares a dictionary of common words
        * assign each words an index, can add whitespace behind a word to reduce compressed size
        * Only works for specific, pre-defined language, e.g., English
      * **adaptive dictionary compression**
        * when decoder encourters letter triplets or entire words that are not yet in the dictionary, then it adds them
    * Zlib: **adaptive dictionary compression + huffman coding**

* ### Git Tag

  * branches are movable tags

  * Used for *important* commits

  * ```sh
    $ git tag -a v13 -m "Our best release!" <COMMMIT ID> # annotated tag, heavier weight tag (message)
    $ git tag v13 <COMMIT ID> # 
    $ git tag # list all tags
    $ git tag -l PATTERN  # show tags contains pattern
    $ git push origin v13  # push the tag v13 to public repository
    $ git tag -s -a v13 -m "Greatest version"  # sign this tag with my GPG key (public/private key)
    ```

  *  Signing tags helps very much for distributing your software securely to your users.

  * For developers, they can verify nothing malicious got introduced in a git commit
