* ### Portability + Standardization

  * shell scripting

  * GNU Linux is a portable operating system
    * it can be run atop 1) X86-64 servers, laptops, ARM architecture, etc

  * First mover advantage is immense
  * Standardization committee makes Standardized interface
    * *Goal*: Encourages Competition
    * Low-level developers needs to implement to these standards, as all their competitors do.
    * High-level developers know their softwares will work as long as they code to the standards
  * Portable Operating System Interface X **POSIX** (1988-2018-?)
    * successful example of standardization
    * specification for OS kernel, Clibrary, and what's visible to shell scripts
    * voluntary standards: succeed if people follow it (small inconsistency)

* ### History of Shell

  * begins with simple notations of controlling jobs

  * Ancester: Job Control Languages **JCLs**: assemly language for shell (bad syntax and configurations)

    * e.g. run a program called PAYROLL
      * `EXEC PAYROLL`   other than that, you need to specify other configurations
      * `SYSIN DD FP=ABC.DEF` specifying the input and output, and also the *size* of output

  * Then, `PAYROLL < ABD.DEF > DEF.GHI` simplifying the syntax and leave out the size of output

  * S. Bourne reengineered the shell, based on user experience ("little languages" tradition)

  * constraints of shell:

    1. interactive (terse, type less)
    2. script (programmable)

  * shell tokens

    * file name contains empty space: `'abc def'`
    * string contains variable: `"abc $x def"`
    * Escaping: `a\"b`

  * next level up: keywords & compound commands

    * are only recognized at the *start* of command

    * `! grep abc /etc/passwd`

    * `{grep abc /etc/passwd; grep def /etc/passwd;}` run those commands in sequence

      * `;` a separate token: allows people to write commands in one line

    * ```{shell}
      if grep foo /etc/passwd; grep bar /etc/passwd
      then
      	commends on success of exit status of last if command
      else 
      	commends on failure of exit status of last if command
      fi  # > outfile , run the entire if-else to the outfile
      ```

    * ```{shell}
      while  # until = while not
      	grep foo $file  # can have many commands here, only use the last exit status
      do
      	file=${file}x # set file be original file + 'x'
      done
      ```

    * ```{shell}
      for i in *.c # (or a.c b.c c.c)  # like python, interating through words
      do 
      	grep $i $i
      done

    * ```{shell}
      f = ...  # f can be any file name
      case $f in 
      	(*.c) gcc $f;;   # f is a file ends in c, then compile it
      	(*.h) echo $f;;   # double ;; means the end of particular case branch
      	(*) echo error $f >&2; exit1;;  # f is some other file, print error message
      esac  # >&2 means make standard output be a dupicate of standard error
      ```

  * Special Variables

    * `$1`, `$2`, `$3`, the first, second, third, ... argument, if there's no argument, output empty string
    * `$0` the name of shell script
    * `$*` all arguments
    * `$#` number of arguments
    * `$@` quotes all arguments (recommended)
    * `${foo-xyz}`   it is `foo` if `$foo` is set, otherwise it is `xyz`.
    * `${foo:-xyz}`  it is `foo` if `$foo` is set and is not empty, otherwise it is `xyz`.
    * `${3?}` if there're 3 argument, set it to be the third argument, otherwise report an error

  * Tilde expansion `~` $$ \equiv $$ `$HOME` ;  `~eggert` $$ \equiv $$ `$HOME/eggert`

  * Command Substitution

    * e.g. `$(git ls-files)  `
    * `grep AINOLAUTOMOUNT $(git ls-files)` 

  * Atrithmatic Expansion: added to shell late

    * `$((3+1))` expands to `4`
    *  `n = $(($n + 1))`  add a variable by 1
    * `(a; b) | c` run `a` and `b` in sequence, and send both the ouput through pipe to `c`
    * `$( (a;b)|c)` add a space between `(` tells shell to use command substitution

  * Field splitting 

    * split expansion into words separated by space, tab, newline

  * File name expansion

    * `*.c`, `[abc]*[xyz]` matches file start with a or b or c and ends with x or y or z

  * Redirection

    * `a b c >f` send the output to `f`
    * `a b c 2>f` send the standard error to `f`
    * `a b c >f 2>&1` send the standard output to `f` and make standard error the same with standard output
    * `a b c >>f` send the standard output append to `f`

  * ### Legal issues in software construction

    * software
      * a set of instructions for computer (1950s)
      * ways to collaborate & communicate (1990s)
        * rules to doing that - commercial law
    * Commercial Law
      1. Copyright law  (designed for creative works, lifetime + 75 years)
      2. Patent law  (designed for inventions, 20 years)
         - you must disclose your invention
      3. Trade secrets 
      4. Trademarks (商标) 
      5. Personal data
    * Legal Protections
      * Lawsuits against infringers by rights holders
    * Technical protections
      * obfuscation
      * hardware protection
    * Softwre licensing
      * A license is a grant instead of a contract
      * it's often part of a contract, but not necessarily
      * It sypically has stings attached... (you can use this only if u ....) READ IT
    * Question for a license
      * must I give credit to the author?  **BSD/MIT/Apache**
      * must I give the source code to whoever I give executables to?  **FSF/GNU**
      * must I grant ownership of my changes to the software authors? 
      * Can I show the source code to others?
      * Can I reverse-enginereer the program?
    * Software and the laws of war
      * casus belli "cause for war"
        * part of "jus ad bellum" cirteria of wether or not you can launch a war legally
          * e.g. reponse to an armed attack on your territory
    * Nowadays software essential infrastructure
    * lanuching a missle & lanuching computer attacks?
      * Stuxnet attack on Iran
        * put virus into iranian computers casuing their nucler material loss
      * attacks on vote counting systems? social network platforms?
