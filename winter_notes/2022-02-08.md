# Version Control

* ### Motivation

  * Alternatives 
  * we want from any system keep track of software system

* ### Version control needs 

  * **history** of each project (backups for operators)
  * planned **future** of each project (incomplete / wrong)



**DevOps**: Developers (write code) + Opeartors (管理员)

* ### Backups (from Ops viewpoint)

  * simple strategy: copy all the data once a day 
    * *cons*:
      * a lot excess work -- most data don't change
      * forget to do it
      * lose up to a day's work
      * need time to copy data, either:
        1. lose access while copying
        2. copy is not self-consistent
  * must have a **failure model**
    * flash drive fails completely
      * Annulized Faliure Rate (0.2% - 2.5%)
    * flash drive fails partially (e.g., one block doesn't work)
    * delete data by mistake (e.g. ```rm -rf /*```)
    * trash data by mistake (e.g. changed a little bit of file)
    * an outside attacter deletes/trashes files
    * an insider deletes/trashes files

* ### What to back up?

  * contents of files 
  * metadata 
    * ```ls -l``` output, e.g. author, data, links
    * ```mant``` output, file system info
  * backup units  ==  blocks (e.g. 8KB) 
  * only backup changed blocks ( **incremental backup** )
    * save effort
    * save time
    * restores more cost

* ### Do we need to back up every change?

  * No - some changes aren't that important
  * files in ```/tmp/*```
    * temperatory files generated

* ### When do we reclaim backed-up storage?







* ### How to do backups cheaply?

  * do them less often
  * do them to a cheaper, slower device
  * remote backup service
  * incremental backups

* ### Incremental backups

  * **block oriented**: 

    * Old Version: 

      | OLD  | b1   | b2   | b3   | ...  |      |      |      | b8   | B9   |
      | :--- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |

    * New Version: 

      | NEW  |      | b2 new staff |      |      |      |      |      | b8 new staff |      |
      | :--- | ---- | :----------: | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | :----------: | ---- |

    * Representation of delta: 

      |  2   | new content |
      | :--: | :---------: |
      |  8   | new content |

    * NEW - OLD = a delta

    * store changes blocks and their contents

  * **stream / text oriented ** :

    * New Version: 

      | NEW  |      | inserted line |      |      |      |      |      | changed line |      |
      | :--- | ---- | :-----------: | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | :----------: | ---- |

    * Block oriented won't work since after insertion every block after that line is changed

    * Representation of delta 

      * insert line 27  ``` line 27: ... ```
      * changes lines 100, 101  ``` line 100: ... ```
      * Delet line ...

    * can fit ```sed``` edit script

* ### Some more optimization

  * **Deduplication**
    * ``` cp a b```  copy ```a``` and writing to ```b```
    * Copy-on-write -- create a linke ```b``` points to ```a```'s data, pretend there's a copy
      * After someone changes ```a``` or ```b``` , make a late copy like ```cp a b```.
    * *cons*: if the user make copy because worrying the flash will collapse

  * **Compression**
  * ```$ gzip < a > b```
      * *pros*: save space (smaller)
      * *cons*: longer to backup and recover
  
  * **Multiplexing**
  * single backup device to backup losts of pieces of data
  
* **Staging**
    * more backup devices that are bigger and slower 
      * like (RAM - flash - drive)

  * **Automated Data Grooming**
  * have a program automatically delete files (or move to another backup device)

* ### Other issues of Backups

  * **Encryption**
    * slower, consuming CPU time
    * good reason to do so: 
  * How do you know your backups work?
    * test backups occationally
    * **checksum**
      * as you make a copy of data, also copy a short checksum
      * store checksum in another device
      * whenever use backup, make sure it matches the checksum



* ### Filesystems with versioning 

  * Traditional
    * simple: automatic, programmer won't worry about it
    * Apps decide when there's a new version (e.g. whenever close, creates a new version)
    * Used in traditional opearting system like ITS, TENEX, OpenVMS
      * ```foo.c;1```
      * ```foo.c;2```
      * ....
    * Has 32767 versions max
    * has data grooming - clean older files

  * **Snapshot**
    
    * filesystem design allows for cheap snapshot of entire filesystem
    
    * idea: all files are immutable
    
      <img src="snapshot.png" alt="Sn" style="zoom:50%;" />
    
    * SeasNET is using this strategy
      * ```cd .snapshot```
      * ```ls -l```
      * ```cd 2022-02-03```
      
    * No updates allowed, cannot modify history

* ### Version Control ('backup for source code' ++)

  * More efficient than file versioning
  * more *useful* than file versioning
  * **Useful Features**: 
    * keep old versions indefinitely (so expensive to develop and small source code)
    * record metadata, too 
      * e.g. Who made the change / When the change is made / regular file or symbolic link?
    * file renaming (important in special case of metadata change)
    * metadata about version control system
      * e.g. can I name a particular version v.2.33.0
    * **atomic changes** to multiple part of the system
      * all or nothing, no intermediate stage
    * Hooks (ability to modify how version control system works)
      * e.g. pre-commit hook - check over changes when commit to ensure following proper style rules
      * a program written by you or others
      * e.g. post-commit hook 
      * makes version control system tailorable
  * More Features
    * navigation and visualization feature
      * be able to see what's the history looks like
    * signed commits 
      * trust the security of project 
    * format conversion
      * e.g. windows system use CR-LF ```\r\n```  while Liunx and MacOS use LF ```\n``` for newlines.
