* ### Static & Dynamic Analysis

* ##### Compiler Typically Write:

  1. a bug exists (warning)

  2. no bug exists (no warning)

  3. ##### <u>a bug may exists, not sure</u>

* ### What should a developer do if compiler issues a false positive warning?

  1. pay no attention
  2. pacify the compiler by adding unnecessary complications
     - Hard to understand
  3. pacify the compiler by shutting off the option
     - e.g. not write `-Wmaybe-uninitialized` 

  - ### Other GCC options

    - ```{shell}
      -fanalyer
      ```

      - like `-Wmaybe-uninitialized` and others, which can has false warning
      - except it applies to the entire module
      - looks at all calls from `f` to `g`,  (both defined in same module)
      - *Pros*: avoid false alarms via more-precise checking
      - *Cons*: way slower to compile, probably $O(N^3)$

    - ```{shell}
      -flto # Link Time Optimization
      ```

      - wait until link all modules together then analyze the whole program
      - if combined with `-fanalyer`, the compile time is way longer

* ### Solutions to speed up the static checking of compiler

  * Write source code easier for static checking

    * keywords /annotations to simplify static checking

      * `_Noreturn`: if define a function with keyword, it doesn't return at all (unlike `void`, which returns without value)
        * Always combine with `void`. e.g.  `_Noreturn void exit(int);`
        * `__attribute__((noreturn))` =  `_Noreturn`

      - **const** attribute

        ```{c}
        int square(int n)__attribute__((const)); 
        ```

        - 1. Unaffected by contents of memory
        - 2. Has no effects on contents of memory
        - **same inputs have same output (guaranteed)**
          - `return square(a) + square(a);` compiler can only call `square(a)` once then adds

      - **pure** attribute

        ```{c}
        int hach(char *p, ptrdiff_t n)__attribute__((pure)); // a hash function which input are a pointer to array of bits and number of bits
        ```

        - Pure not modify memory but may access storage visible to the rest of program
        - Has no effects on contents of memory but may be affected by contents of memory
        - note: `int hach(char const *p)` only promise not modify momery through `p`
          - `return hach(a) + hach(a);` compiler can only call `hash(a)` once then adds
          - but if `p` or memory changed between two calls, then we need to call twice

      - print format option

        ```{c}
        int my_printf(void *my_object, char const *format, ...)__attribute__((format(printf, 2,3))); 
        // ... menas there're many arguments but not check their types
        // 2 corresponds to format and 3 corresponds to ...
        my_printf(o, "x=%d", x);  // x is int, ok; x is double, there's an error
        ```

      - nonnull option

        ```{c}
        int my_printf(void *my_object, char const *format, ...)__attribute__((format(printf, 2,3), nonnull(1))); // object is not null
        ```

      - other options

        ```{c}
        void *my_alloc(ptrdiff_t)__attribute__((alloc_size(1), return_nonnull, malloc(free, 1)))
        ```

        - `return_nonnull` if you get an address from `my_alloc`, you know it's not null.
        - `malloc(free, 1)` tells this allocator returns storage, and you should free by calling the `free` function and passing the storage as the frist argument, otherwise there's warning

* ### Dynamic Checking

  ```{shell}
  -fsanitize=address  # ASan (Address sanitization)
  ```

  - The compiler is supposed to generate machine code to check if the program is accessing memory correctly

  ```{shell}
  -fsanitize=leak # LSan (Leak sanitization)
  ```

  - finding memory leaks (subset of ASan)
  - faster and cheaper than ASan

  ```{shell}
  -fsanitize=thread  # dangerous
  ```

  - catch race conditions in multithreaded programs
  - In case programmer forget to put correct locks
  - inserts random/program delays (to make it more likely to happen in same time) bug%++

  ```{shell}
  -fsanitize=undefined  # 
  ```

  - Whenever undefined behavior (e.g.`INT_MAX + 1`), program to crush reliably 
    - not caught by other `-fasanitize` flags
    - `-fwrapv` means integer overflow wraps around mod $ 2^{32} $
    - Only in C, C++, Java, but not Python or Elisp (integers are not bounded) 

* ### Valgrind

  * like `-fsanitize`, but it runs with ordinary executables, no need to re-compile
  * can run it on any installed programs (e.g. in Emacs)
  * `$ valgrind cat a b`  (/bin/cat)  
  * Cons: interpret executable, so it's slow at runtime & has less information

* ### Portability Checking

  * any change to platform might break the code
  * `gcc foo.c` (on X86-64) vs `gcc -m32 foo.c` (on X86)

* ### How GCC works inside (CS 132)

  * Compiler portability

  * Platforms:

    1. target - machine GCC generate code for
    2. build - machine you're compiling GCC on
    3. Host - machine that GCC will run on

  * ##### GCC supports

    * A flat address space

      | 0    |      |      |      | ...  |      |
      | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |

    * Variations: int 8, 16, 32, 64 

    * Does code line in same address space as data?

      | instructions | data |
      | ------------ | ---- |

  * ##### GCC can compile:

    1. Languages: C, C++, Java, Mercury, ...
    2. Platforms: x86-64, x86, ARM, RISCV, ...

  * No matter for which language, GCC generate GENERIC trees, 

  * Then eventually it gets to high-level machine-independent description of code (GIMPLE) machine code trees
