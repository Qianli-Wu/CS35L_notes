* ### Git

  ```shell
  $ git clone # clones existing repository + creates working file & empty index
  ```

  ```shell
  $ git diff # working files - (repository + index)
  $ git diff --staged (or --cached)  # compare index files with last committed files
  $ git diff foo.c bar.h  # only show differences for these files
  $ git diff A..B  # assuming A & B are commmit IDs
  # if there's a collision in commit name and file name:
  $ git diff A -- F  # look at the commit A and focus on difference in file F
  ```

  ```shell
  $ git log  # output the entire history of the project
  $ git log A..B  # limits and logs between commit A and commit B
  ```

  - **Commit expressions**
    - `A^`   A's parent
    - `A^^^^^ `, `HEAD~3`
    - `HEAD`   most recent commit
    - `name `   named commit
    - `A^!`    $\equiv$  `A^..A ` the difference between A's parent and A

  ```shell
  $ git status # reminds you of what you're up to
  ```

  ```shell
  $ git grep PATTERN  # =  grep PATTERN $(git ls-files)
  ```

  ```shell
  $ git config -l # list configuration from .git/config (in current directory) and ~/.gitconfig (global) and other files
  ```

  ```shell
  $ git show HEAD   # git log + git diff
  $ git show A..B  
  ```

  ```shell
  $ git blame FILE  # see who contributed what in a FILE
  $ git blame A -- FILE
  ```

  ```shell
  $ git bisect # figure out who introduced the bug, narrowing the problem down
  # specify a test case (any shell command), run it between good commit and bad commit in Binary Search O(logN)
  $ git bisect HEAD # HEAD is bad
  $ git bisect v27 # v27 is good
  $ git bisect run make check  # "make check" can be any shell command
  # problem1: GGBGGBBBGGBB  # bad versions happen mixed with good versions
  # problem2: different branches, one good and one bad
  ```

  ```shell
  $ git fetch  # copy remote repository into ours (into a separate area)
  # git fetch only update remote branch (e.g. origin/main)
  $ git merge origin/master  
  
  $ git checkout main
  $ git merge <branch name> # look at common ancester A, then do a 3-way diff
  $ git merge <parent1> <parent2> <parent3> ...  # can merge with multiple parents
  ```

  ```shell
  $ diff3 -m O A N # Other(O), Common-Ancester(A), New-Version(N)
  # !!! Can't assume other parts without conflicts are good
  ```

  - Branch
    - a lightweight *movable* pointer to a commit (move the pointer for every new commit)
  - Tag
    - a lightweight pointer to a commit
    - `git tag [-a] <tag> [-m <tag message>] [<commit id>]`
  - Commit
    - Avoid changing history, especially in public repository: other developers may rely on it. 
    

  ```shell
  $ git pull   # git fetch + git merge
  # some philosophy: you should never pull to avoid merges
  # it depends on how you worried about merge (languages like C/C++ not good for merge)
  ```

  ```shell
  $ git fetch # make sure the copy of upstream is up-to-date
  $ git rebase origin/main  # like a merge
  ```

  - cons: lying about history, **never do it in published repository**
  - pros: has a much simpler history, a long straight line
  - better for small staff (rebase than merge)
