* ### Debug

  * static checking helps to avoid debugging
  * dynamic checking makes the bugs easier to detect when they occur
  * write testing cases helps
    * good coverage
    * not to overkill
    * *Goal*: write test cases that **break** your program: find the bugs in program
    * Test Driven Development: write test cases before writing the code

* ### Too Many Bugs?

  * use a better platform

    * e.g. switch from C to Rust

  * ##### Defensive programming

    * *idea*: assume other codes may have mistakes

    * *idea*: not trust all other codes in your program (defend bugs elsewhere)

    * **Barricades** (check before main code)        `if (n < 0) {exit(1);}`

    * **Taces & logs**   (tools)              e.g. `printf(...)`

    * **Checkpoint / restart** 

      * for every 10 minutes, pause and save the entire state into a file
      * If the program crushed, then resume from the most recent checkpoint

    * **Assertions**

      * like Barricades, but "stronge" version
      * `assert(n >= 0)` if it is, then keep going; otherwise, crush the program

    * **Exception handling**

      ```{python}
      try {
        
      } catch 
      ```

    * **Interpreters** (software that runs the code "carefully")

      * give you almost complete control over dubious code (valgrind) (browsers)
      * Slower 
        * overhead of interpreter

    * **Virtual Machines** or other form of containers

      * Hardware-assisted interpreter

* ### None of the above prevented your bug?

  * How to debug? (summary)
    * Don't guess random for where the bug is   (only works for tiny program)
    * **Stablize the failure** (make the bug reproducible)
      * can be tricky in multicore/distributed apps - stop multi-threads
      * try small test cases
    * Locate the failure's cause $$\Rightarrow $$ locate the fault
      * Failure: the program fails in an observable way: users can see the answers are wrong
      * Fault: a latent bug in the program that could lead to a failure
      * Error: the mistake in software developer's head that caused the fault to be there
    * Fix the bug

* ### Debugger

  * **GDB**

    * most popular, low-level

    ```{shell}
    (gdb) set cwd DIR
    (gdb) set env TZ Europe/Pari
    (gdb) set disable-randomization
    (gdb) run -x a b c 
    (gdb) attach 39216 (process id) # tells GDB to take control over a running program
    (gdb) detach       # leave the program like GDB have never been there
    ```

    * maintains a tight control of program (execute instructions one by one)
    * reading data from program / write data into the program when the execution stops
    * ASLR: Address Space Layout Randomization
      * allocate memory in random location (not predictable) to aovid buffer overflow attacks
    
  * Cntrolling/stopping/starting

    ```shell
    (gdb) b diffmain (function name)  # stop the program when execute diffmain
    (gdb) info break  # show all break points
    (gdb) del 27 # delete the 27th (get from info break) break point
    ```
  
  * Stepping

    ```shell
    (gdb) step（s)  # step one source-code line (may taken multiple instructions)
    # The order of machine code and source code may different 
    # execute in source code order & step into the functions called in code lines
    (gdb) next (n) # one source-code line, but don't stop inside inferior functions
    (gdb) finish # keep executing the current function until it finishes
    (gdb) u <location> # continue until either reach the location or exit the function
    (gdb) c # continue: run until there's a breakpoint or end the program
    ```
  
  * Fancier commands

    ```shell
    (gdb) checkpoint # takes a snapshot of the current program's state and store in a file, given a restart id (in case to come back to it later)
    (gdb) restart RID # RID = restart id
    (gdb) rc # reverse continue 反向运行程序直到遇到一个能使程序中断的事件 (breakpoint, ...)
    (gdb) watch EXPR # create watchpoint for this EXPR (expression)
    	(gdb) watch m < 0 # between every pair of instruction, if the values changes, then act like a break point
    	# intel: 4 watch points are supported in hardware, thus increase the speed
    ```
