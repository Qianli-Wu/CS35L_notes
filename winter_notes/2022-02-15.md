* ### Low Level Tools (pros)

  * being around longer
  * low level tools are universal (MacOS, Linux, Android, ...)
  * close to the middle

* ### How to build software & configuring (low level)

  * Consider **Audiences**:
    * *Developers* - who write the software
    * *Builders* - transform source code to excutable code in various platform
    * *Distributors* - send the executable program to users
    * *Installers* - put copies on user machine and configure that
    
  * Methods to build
    * build by hand  ```$ g++ foo.c```  and `./a.out`.
    
    * Write a shell script to build 
    
      * write a script called `build.foo` that includes that following code
    
        ```{shell}
        #! /bin/bash
        g++ -c foo1.c  # generate foo1.o
        g++ -c foo2.c
        g++ -c foo3.c
        g++ foo[123].o -o foo
        ```
        
      * If add a module, we need to change the script (acceptable). 
      
      * easy to teach others to compile
      
      * specific to one project
      
      * shell script **cons**:
      
        1. doesn't handle incremental build well
           - re-build everything from scratch with any change
        2. hard to parallelize. 
      
        ```{shell}
        # Try to parallel the processes
        g++ -c foo1.c &  # running the process in the background
        pid1=$!  # process id of the most recent process in the background
        g++ -c foo2.c &
        pid2=$!
        g++ -c foo3.c &
        pid3=$!
        wait $pid1; wait $pid2; wait $pid3;
        g++ foo[123].o -o foo
        # Nobody like to write this, but also need to address 2.
        ```
      
    * **'Make'** 
    
      * a build tool designed for developers
      * a layer above shell
      * attack problem #1 (but also #2) via *dependencies* in rules. 
    
      ```{makefile}
      foo: foo1.o foo2.o foo3.o   # behind the comma are dependencies
      	g++ foo1.o foo2.o foo3.o -o foo
      foo1.o: foo.c
      	g++ -c foo.c
      ```
    
      - Use **timesteps** on file to determine wether a dependency is satisfied
      - `make -j4` do parallel so long as respect *dependencies*
      - `make -j` use as much as parallels as possible

* ##### Common idioms in makefiles

  * Macros

    ```{makefile}
    XYZ = foo1.o foo2.o foo3.o
    foo: XYZ  # foo: foo1.o foo2.o foo3.o
    	g++ XYZ -o foo
    ```

  * Leading '-' before a command

    ```{makefile}
    distclean: distclean-recursive
    	-rm -f $(am_CONFIG_DISTCLEAN_FILES)  
    	-rm -f Makefile
    ```

    * makefile usually *stop* when a command fails, opposite to shell script
    * Keep going even if that command fails
    * Ignore exit status of failed commands

  * Phony targets

    * not actual files trying to build
    * but 'make' can still use their dependencies

* ### Make file in each level directory

  * How to link sub makefiles?

    1. **recursion** 

       - start building faster

       ```{makefile}
       buildall: top-buildall
       for s in lib, src; do \    # lib and src are subdirectories
       	(cd $$s && ${MAKE) buildall;)
       done
       top-buildall: f1 f2 ..
       ```

    2. **inclusion**

       - can make decisions based on global information

       ```{makefile}
       top level makefile
       include lib/Makefile    # lib and src are subdirectories
       include src/Makefile    # pretend these makefiles are there (like C++)
       buildall: top-buildall lib-buildall src-buildall
       ```

* ### How to debugging (low level)

  * Makefile bugs
    1. wrong shell command       (e.g. java compiler instead of g++)
    2. misspell a macro name.    (e.g. `$(ZYZ)` but should be `$(XYZ)` )
    3. excess dependencies       (suboptimal 'make')
    4. missing dependencies       (build the wrong version)

* ### A program Copy files efficiently

  * Create a buffer, read(standard input, buffer, size of buffer)

* ##### ./configure
  
  * Can hand-write 5000+ lines
  * Generate automatically

* ### A package is files that intend to be installed and upadted together

* ### Package manager

  * keep track of installed packages

  * check that installed files are of

  * Package dependencies

  * package updates

    * security fixes (or other bugs).  --patch level
    * adding new features.     -- minor release
    * decommissioning features.   -- major release
    * 27.3.2

    | major release | minor release | patch level |
    | ------------- | ------------- | ----------- |
    | 27            | 3             | 2           |
