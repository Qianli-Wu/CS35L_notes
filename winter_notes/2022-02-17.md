* ### Portable Low-level software Debugging

  * C $\approx$ C++: not the popular for new apps at higher levels
  * Higher languages or applications written in **C**:
    * C-Python: standard implementation of **Python** is written in C (a interpreter written in C)
    * EmacsLisp   &   Linux kernel
  * Higher languages or applications written in **C++**
    * Chrominun   &   Firefox   &   JavaScript

* ### C++ 

  * gives an abstraction layer atop C, a better layer

  * originally design: (a processor translate C++ code to C code)

  * **classes & objects **, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism (can be done in C if you like)

    ```{c}
    struct s {          // do classes in C
      int a,b,
      int (*sum)(void);   // a pointer to function 'sum()'
    }                     // can be considered as a method 'sum()' for class 's'
    ```
  
  * struct can have static data members + functions
  
  * namespace control (`using namespace std;` and `std::cout`)
  
  * overloading is easy

  * exception handling is easy (`try` and `catch`); C has `<setjump.h>`, but awkward
  
  * memory allocation is built-in
  
    ```{c++}
    new, delete// C++
    ```
  
    ```{c}
    malloc(sizeof(struct s))   // Library function in C
    void *malloc(size_t)
    ```
  
  * stdio is simpler `cin >>` and `cout << `
  
  * call by reference in c++ `int f(int &a){...}`is same with`int f(int *a){...}`in c
  
* ### Anatomy of a traditional C/C++ environment

  * Preprocessor: `gcc -E`, `foo.c`
  * Assembly code: `gcc -S`, `foo.s`
    * `nbr64` carney; defend against common stack overflow attacks
  * Object code: `gcc -c`, `foo.o`
    * can be compared to assembly code by `objdump -d`
  * Link `foo.o` with C library

* ### Auxiliary Programs (other than gcc)

  * Operations tools
    * ps: details of each process
      * `ps -ef`: all the processes that are running and other information
    * time: shows real time  +  (user) CPU time  +  system time
    * top: show all running process by CPU order
  * debugging tools


* ### What GCC is god for? (other than compiling to machine code)

  * Security implement 
    * `gcc -fstack-protector`: program to crash reliably, faster
      * canary: check if the buffer is not changed (value in canary bit doesn't change)
    * run-time checking

* ### Performance improvement in gcc

  * `-O`  "optimize"
  * `-O0  -O1   **-O2**  -O4` ... spend more time on compile, optimize "harder" but harder to debug
  * after `O4` is very hard to debug since the lost of activation records 
  * O2 has out-of-order execution: (not in hardware level)
    * assembly code in `.s` file has different order in `.c` file. 
  * changing your O-option can 'fix' a bug or introduce a bug
  * `-flto` Link time optimization; increase great amount of time when compile

* ### Source-code changes for performance 

  * `__builtin_unreachable()` this function cannot be called

  * `__attribute__()`

    ```{c++}
    char x[100]__attribute__((abgned(16))); // array has an address is multiple of 16
    void exit(int)__attribute__((cold));  // rarely called in practice
    int getchar(void)__attribute__((hot)); // will be called a lot times
    ```

  * ##### Profiling

    * `gcc --coverage` or other options
    * keep track for each machine instruction: how often they're executed
    * when your program runs, its outputs a profile which can deduce how often each line was executed
    * `gcov` can use the profile why the instruction is so slow

* ### Checking

  * ##### Static Checking (source code)

    * done once & good for all runs
    
    * not as flexible or smart as **dynamic checking**
    
    * `_static_assert(E, "message");`
      
      * `E` is any constant expression
      
      * If `E` is not true, then print the message and stop the program.
      
        ```{c}
        static_assert(2000000000 < INT_MAX, "get a bigger machine");
        ```
      
      * ensure the program will not be built on unintended platform
    
  * **GCC optons** 

    ```{shell}
    gcc -Wall foo.c.  # turn on all warnings (too many)
    -Wcomment # warning about inappropriate comments  e.g. /*abc/*edf*/
    -Wparentheses # warn unclear 执行顺序 e.g. a<<b+c => a<<(b+c),  a&&b||c => (a&&b)||c
    -Waddress # warn address operator  e.g. char *p; if (p == "xyz")...
    -Wstrict=aliasing # Controversial: warn undefined behavior at run time 
    -Wmaybe-uninitialized # (one method/function at a time)
    -Wextra # Controversial: too many false alarms
    	-Wtype-limits # makes it harder to write generic code
    ```
